    "challenge": "VIDL Life’s website faces several key challenges common to e-commerce platforms. First, offering multiple customization options (e.g., color, lid type, and message) can complicate the user experience, potentially making navigation less intuitive. Ensuring fast load times and smooth performance while displaying high-quality images and customizations is another challenge, especially as site traffic grows. As a newer brand, building customer trust and credibility is crucial, particularly in the competitive personalized product market. Mobile optimization is also essential, given the increasing number of shoppers using mobile devices. Additionally, managing orders for customized products and handling global shipping logistics can create complexities around cost, delivery time, and customer satisfaction. These challenges require ongoing attention to maintain an efficient, user-friendly website.",
